- commit : snapshot of all files at a point in time
- branch : lightweight pointers to work in progress

! Initial setup required:
- git config --global user.name "Your Name"
- git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

Flow:
- Working directory (status = modified): $ git add
- Stage area [index] (status = staged): $ git commit
- Local repository (status = commited): $ git push

## GitHub ##

- Having your Git "user.email" matching your GitHub profile ease the integration.
- Public or private repositories, to collaborate or personal use.
- Start working running a [code]$ git pull [/code] as a best practice.
- Rebase, merge and conciliate conflicts between local and remote repositories.
- Explore interesting projects and repositories, bookmark them with the star.
- If you intend to collaborate code to them: fork, new branch commit, start a pull request.
